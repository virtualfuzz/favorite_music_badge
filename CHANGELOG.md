# Changelog

## v0.0.1

- youtube music support (gets the top music by scraping the youtube music
  website)

## v0.1.0

- attempt to use the gitlab/github cicd (broken because youtube does not allow
  gitlab/github cicd to scrape their website) so its mostly useless

## v1.0.0

- add detailed documentation on how to run, how to use cicd, etc...
- make it more robust to re-runs by deleting the folders it creates to prevent
  errors
